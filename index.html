<h1>What is a cool person</h1>
    <p>A cool person is someone who doesn’t try to be cool and somehow still pulls it off. They’re confident enough to laugh at themselves, chill enough to not care what everyone thinks, and kind enough to not be a jerk about it. They don’t brag, they don’t force jokes, and they don’t say “trust me, I’m cool” (because that’s an automatic red flag). Basically, a cool person just exists, and everyone else agrees, “yeah… that person’s cool.”</p>

<h2>Who is a good example of a cool person</h2>
<p>A good example of a cool person is Keanu Reeves—he’s famous, rich, and loved worldwide, yet he rides the subway, donates quietly, and treats everyone with respect, all without flexing or acting superior. He’s confident but humble, kind without being fake, and somehow effortlessly chill, which is what really makes someone cool.</p>
