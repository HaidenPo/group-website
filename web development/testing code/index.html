    <h2>What is Football</h2>
     <p><em>American football is a team sport where two teams try to score points by moving an oval-shaped ball down the field to the other team’s end zone, either by running with it or throwing it. The other team tries to stop them. Teams can also score by kicking the ball through the goalposts. The game is played in four quarters, and players have different roles, like quarterback, running back, or receiver.  It’s a physical and strategic game.</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football">10</a></sup></p>

    <h3>strongHow is Football played</h3>
        <p>American football is played between two teams of 11 players. <strong>The goal is to score points by carrying or throwing an oval-shaped ball into the opponent’s end zone for a touchdown or by kicking it through the goalposts for a field goal.</strong> The team with the ball has four tries, called downs, to move it 10 yards; if they succeed, they get another four downs. The game has four quarters, and the other team tries to stop them by tackling players or blocking plays. Penalties happen if rules are broken, and points can also be scored by extra-point kicks or safeties.</p>
